# Internationalization (I18N)

The i18n js files under this directory will be convert to VSCode i18n files in the root directory of this project by script: `utils/setup-i18n.js`.

So execute `utils/setup-i18n.js` after you modify js files in this directory.

And the `zh-tw.js` file is generated from `zh-cn.js` via [opencc]. (script: `utils/zhs-to-zht.sh`)
